# Python Adventure Game

An old-fashioned text-based adventure game written to practice coding in Python
as part of the [Udacity - Introduction to Programming Nano Degree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000)

After reviewing the instructions for this project, I realized
I would have to add some design elements of my own. I had
never played or written an adventure game. After some
research, I "napkin" designed a game that included
adversaries, treasure, weapons, and armor.

I had already learned some Python from another online course. 
I gave myself the challenge of implementing my design, while only
using the Python features and the programming style presented 
in the course materials.

The project implements a "nosql" like data storage structure
in `db.py`, which is used to store the game configuration and to manage
game status throughout play.

The `setup.py` file contains configuration settings for the game. It 
defines and allows changes and additions to many game elements, including
adversaries, armor, treasures, weapons, locations, and player objectives.

Coding for project required strict adherence to the PEP 8 style guide.
