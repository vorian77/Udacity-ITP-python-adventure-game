# Python Adventure Game

Project: Adventure Game

Demonstrate your Python skills by coding a simple version of
an old-fashioned text-based adventure game.

After reviewing the instructions for this project, I realized
I would have to add some design elements of my own. I had
never played or written an adventure game. After some
research, I "napkin" designed a game that included
adversaries, treasure, weapons, and armor.

As a way to practice and improve my Python skills, I gave
myself the challenge of implementing the design, while only
using the Python features and the programming style presented 
in the course materials.

The project implements a "nosql" like data storage structure
in db.py used to store the game configuration and to manage
game status throughout play.
